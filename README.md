Topological Language Models (TopoLMs) - a new class of neural architectures that leverage topological concepts to capture the intrinsic geometric structure of language data that traditional methods systematically miss. The core innovation lies in treating text not as mere sequences or bags of words, but as complex topological spaces where words form manifolds, relationships exhibit higher-order structure, and linguistic patterns persist across multiple scales. This approach enables the extraction of stable topological features that provide deeper insights into semantic structure, grammatical relationships, and discourse patterns

# Topological nature of Language
Traditional NLP approaches fundamentally misunderstand the geometric nature of language by treating it as linear sequences rather than recognizing its inherent topological structure
Words form complex manifolds in embedding spaces that reflect deep linguistic relationships, exhibiting properties like connectivity, holes, and higher-dimensional structures that encode semantic and syntactic information

We'll need an understanding of topology on an undergrad level atleast to follow along.

# Semantic Topology
- Word embeddings naturally form lower-dimensional manifolds within high-dimensional spaces, with the topology encoding semantic relationships and linguistic structure 
- Certain linguistic patterns remain stable across different scales of analysis, from local word relationships to global discourse structure
- Higher-Order Relations: Language involves complex multi-way interactions that go beyond simple pairwise relationships, requiring tools from algebraic topology to         properly capture
